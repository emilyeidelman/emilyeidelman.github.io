        <h3>Chi Omega Recruitment Chair, September 2013-Present</h3>
          <p>I am a member of Chi Omega’s charter class at the University of Miami. I was elected to serve on the executive board as the Colony Recruitment Chair in the fall.

I lead training sessions in communication, planned themes, outfits and decorations, and I kept the chapter organized and in good spirits during the stressful week of recruitment. I am currently working to plan recruitment 2015.</p>

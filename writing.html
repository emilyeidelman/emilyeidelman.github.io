  <h1>My Writing</h1>

  <p>I am studying journalism at the University of Miami. I've had many great experiences as a student here, allowing me to write articles on a wide array of topics. I have shared articles ranging in topics from sports, to online dating, to working as a campus representative. All have been published in <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/">the Miami Hurricane</a>, the student newspaper, or <a href="http://www.distractionmagazine.com/">Distraction</a>, the student magazine.</p>

  <h3>"Tennis coach stresses hard work, competitive drive"</h3>
  <div id="tennis" ></div>
  <p>It’s noon on an average Thursday. The University of Miami women’s tennis team practices in the blazing sun. In the corner of the court stands head coach Paige Yaroshuk-Tews. She balances words of encouragement with a fair amount of criticism as the players run through drills over and over again.</p>

<p>Yaroshuk-Tews has been watching the UM women’s team play since she was a child. She recalls how well the team played and how their greatness inspired her. When she came to coach at UM in 2001, the team was ranked 37th in the country. It was during her first practice here as head coach that she decided to instill her work ethic on the court into her players.</p>

  <h3>"Canes aim to build reputation among other competitors"</h3>
    <div id="rowing" ></div>
    <p>The women’s rowing team at the University of Miami drills motivational phrases into the minds of the athletes every day.</p>

      <p>“Make fast choices” and “Do everything with purpose” are two of its favorite mantras.</p>

      <p>These words emphasize the importance of speed while getting the team ready for racing season.</p>

      <p>Six mornings per week, the Hurricanes wake up before the sun rises. Before most students open their eyes, the rowing team has already finished a mile-and-a-half run and a two-hour row. After that, the team completes three extra afternoon sessions, including weight lifting and cardio.</p>
